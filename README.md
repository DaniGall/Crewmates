# Web Development Project 7 - *Crewmates*

Submitted by: **Daniela Gallego**

This web app: ** Crewmate Creator is a web app that lets users build, customize, and manage a team of crewmates by assigning them unique attributes such as name, speed, color, and category. Users can create, edit, view, and delete crewmates, with the ability to filter color options based on selected categories. The app also includes a summary dashboard that displays statistics like the percentage of fast crewmates and a custom success score based on team composition and diversity, making it easy to track and evaluate the strength of your crew.**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Features

  -  The summary page is sorted by creation date such that the most recently created crewmates appear at the top
- [x] **A previously created crewmate can be updated from the list of crewmates in the summary page**
  - Each crewmate has an edit button that will take users to an update form for the relevant crewmate

  - e.g., a Dungeons and Dragons class or a development team role (project manager, product owner, etc.)
  - User can choose a `category` option to describe their crewmate before any attributes are specified
  - Based on the category value, users are allowed to access only a subset of the possible attributes

## Notes

This app I have struggles in giving supabase the right permissions about editing such as EDIT, DELETE and INSERT, I had to read a lot of documentation in order to figure these isssues out. That was for sure the most confussing and time consuming part of this project.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
